# knn_Arthritis_Predictor

The objective is to build a model with the given features(input) and predict whether the target variable(output) is normal or abnormal
Classification: target variable consists of categories like normal or abnormal

Concept:
The intuition behind the KNN algorithm is one of the simplest of all the supervised machine learning algorithms.
It simply calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training data points.
The distance can be of any type e.g Euclidean or Manhattan etc.
It then selects the K-nearest data points, where K can be any integer.
Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong.

Classification method.
First we need to train our data. Train = fit
fit(): fits the data, train the data.
predict(): predicts the data
x: features
y: target variables(normal, abnormal)
